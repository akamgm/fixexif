# fixexif

A small script to update the exif timestamp of all files in a directory to have the same year.

I wanted to create a photo-a-day calendar (using socialprintstudio.com) where each photo was taken on the same calendar day, but from different years. The easiest way to do this was to update the exif timestamp of all the photos to have the same year.

The `missing.py` script is just a sanity check to make sure no days were missed.
